var vs let vs const:- 
 
 Hoisting & scoping :- 
 => developer mistake
 => if we print a variable without decalration it leads to hoisting.
 => in var it will print undefined
 => in let and const it will throw an error
 => let and const are block variables
 => var is global variable.
 
 //example for hoisting:-
 console.log(a);
 var/let/const a =2;

//example for scoping:-
function test(){
  let b =2;
    if(true){
        let c =3;
    }
    console.log(b,c)
}
test();
